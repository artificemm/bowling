# Ten-pin bowling challenge for Jobsity

## Aplicant: Roberto Ruiz

Ten-pin bowling program will be run from the command line, taking a text file as argument for reading, parsing it and outputting a formatted text following the rules of a standard bowling game scoring system.

This text will be changing with the project as commits shape the whole challenge.

## Usage:

$ ruby game.rb <filename.txt>

This will output the game rolls as a scoreboard formatted as requested.
